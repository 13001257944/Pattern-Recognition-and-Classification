A pattern recognition & classification system. 

Dataset: - Bank Marketing (downloaded from Machine Learning Repository of University of California, Irvine)

Programming language: - Python

Strategies & techniques: - Data preprocessing - Data cleaning, feature selection; Pattern recognition & classification - Maximum likelihood, Bayesian method, Quadratic classifier, k-nearest neighbor algorithms

Results: - The data was successfully classified in two classes and quadratic classifiers had 80% accuracy whereas 1-Nearest Neighbour had 99.6% accuracy (I used k=1)
